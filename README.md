Project-3

For this week's project, I experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment. I followed the listed descriptions and specifications to create several functions. I gain a lot experience debugging my code and fixing the problem of my function. 

For this assignment, we combined the HTML and Javascript together. We wrote function to count conits and make the page responsive.
